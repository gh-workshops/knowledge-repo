Since NOAA has made their data public, let us explore the data ourselves and see what insights we can discover. \n\n1. How many weather stations in US?\n2. For US weather stations, what is the average years of record keeping?\n3. For each US weather station, on each day of the year, identify the frequency at which daily High and Low temperature records are broken.\n4. Does the historical frequency of daily temperature records (High or Low) in the US provide statistical evidence of dramatic climate change?\n5. What is the average life-span of a daily temperature record (High or Low) in the US?\n\nThis analytical notebook is a component of a package of notebooks.

Over 25,000 worldwide weather stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCN-Daily is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCN-Daily station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\nThis notebook was developed using a <strong>March 16, 2015</strong> snapshot of USA-Only daily temperature readings from the Global Historical Climatology Network.

Since weather is something that can be observed at varying intervals, the process used by NCDC is the best that we have yet it is far from ideal. Optimally, weather metrics should be observed, streamed, stored and analyzed in real-time. Such an approach could offer the data as a service associated with a data lake.\n\n> [Data lakes](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology-forecast/2014/cloud-computing/features/data-lakes.jhtml) that can scale at the pace of the cloud remove integration barriers and clear a path for more timely and informed business decisions.\n\nAccess to cloud-based data services that front-end a data lake would help to reduce the possibility of human error and divorce us from downstream processing that alters the data from it's native state.   \n\n#### Available datasets\n\nNOAA NCDC provides public FTP access to the **GHCN-Daily dataset**, which contains a file for each US weather station. Each file contains historical daily data for the given station since that station began to observe and record. Here are some details about the available data:\n\n* The data is delivered in a **text file based, fixed record machine-readable format**. \n* Version 3 of the GHCN-Daily dataset was released in September 2012. \n* Changes to the processing system associated with the Version 3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on most weekdays. \n* Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. \n* Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, snowfall and snow depth. \n\n##### Citation Information\n\n* [GHCN-Daily journal article](doi:10.1175/JTECH-D-11-00103.1): Menne, M.J., I.

Essentially, we seek to explode (decompress) the data for general consumption and [normalize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization#Normal_forms) it into a relational model that may be informative to users.\n\n### Desired Data Schema\n\n#### Historical Daily Summary\nThe goal here is to capture summary information about a given day throughout history at a specific weather station in the US. This dataset contains 365 rows where each row depicts the aggregated low and high temperature data for a specific day throughout the history of the weather station.  \n\nColumn | Description \n--- | --- \nStation ID | Name of the US Weather Station\nMonth |Month of the observations\nDay | Day of the observations\nFirstYearOfRecord | First year that this weather station started collecting data for this day in in history.\nTMin | Current record low temperature (F) for this day in history.\nTMinRecordYear | Year in which current record low temperature (F) occurred.  \nTMax | Current record high temperature (F) for this day in history. \nTMaxRecordYear | Year in which current record high temperature occurred. \nCurTMinMaxDelta | Difference in degrees F between  record high and low records for this day in history.\nCurTMinRecordDur | LifeSpan of curent low record temperature.\nCurTMaxRecordDur | LifeSpan of current high record temperature.\nMaxDurTMinRecord | Maximum years a low temperature record was held for this day in history.\nMinDurTMinRecord | Minimum years a low temperature record was held for this day in history.\nMaxDurTMaxRecord | Maximum years a high temperature record was held for this day in history.\nMinDurTMaxRecord | Minimum years a high temperature record was held for this day in history.\nTMinRecordCount | Total number of TMin records set on this day (does not include first since that may not be a record).\nTMaxRecordCount | Total number of TMax records set on this day (does not include first since that may not be a record).\n\n#### Historical Daily Detail\nThe goal here is to capture details for each year that a record has changed for a specific weather station in the US. During the processing of the Historical Daily Summary dataset, we will log each occurrence of a new temperature record. Information in this file can be used to drill-down into and/or validate the summary file. \n\nColumn | Description \n--- | --- \nStation ID | Name of the US Weather Station\nYear | Year of the observation\nMonth |Month of the observation\nDay | Day of the observation\nType | Type of temperature record (Low = *TMin*, High = *TMax*)\nOldTemp | Temperature (F) prior to change.\nNewTemp | New temperature (F) record for this day.\nTDelta | Delta between old and new temperatures.\n\n#### Historical Daily Missing Record Detail\nThe goal here is to capture details pertaining to missing data. Each record in this dataset represents a day in history that a specific weather station in the USA failed to observe a temperature reading.\n\nColumn | Description \n--- | --- \nStation ID | Name of the US Weather Station\nYear | Year of the missing observation\nMonth |Month of the missing observation\nDay | Day of the missing observation\nType | Type of temperature missing (Low = *TMin*, High = *TMax*)\n\n#### Historical Raw Detail\n\nThe goal here is to capture raw daily details.

Therefore, the format we choose to capture and store our desired data should also allow us to organize and append future datasets.\n\nThe [HDF5 Python Library](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/) provides support for the standard Hierarchical Data Format. This library will allow us to:\n\n1. Create, save and publish derived datasets for reuse.\n2. Organize our datasets into groups (folders). \n3. Create datasets that can be easily converted to/from dataframes. \n\nHowever, HDF5 files can be very large which could be a problem if we want to share the data. Alternatively, we could store the information in new collections of CSV files where each ```.csv``` contained weather station specific content for one of our target schemas.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "# Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)\n\nThe focus of this notebook is to perform the to compute intensive activities that will **explode** the **text file based, fixed record machine-readable format** into the derived data schemas we have specified.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Gather Phase 1\n\nThe purpose of this phase will be to do the following:\n\n* For each daily data file (*.dly) provided by NOAA:\n     * For each record where ELEMENT == TMAX  or TMIN\n         * Identify missing daily temperature readings, write them to the missing dataset.\n         * Convert each daily temperature reading from celcius to fahrenheit, write each daily reading to the raw dataset.\n        \n#### Approach 1: Comma delimited files\n\nUse the code below to layout your target project environment (if it should differ from what is described herein) and then run the process for *Gather Phase 1*.
